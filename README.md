# Windows 95 Key generator
A simple Windows 95 OEM key generator, written in Python. When I tested this script I noticed that this script can generate sometimes invalid keys, but most of the times it will generate valid keys.
This repo also includes a Windows 95 CD key generator also written in Python, enjoy!
